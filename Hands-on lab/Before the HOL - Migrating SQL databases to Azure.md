# Migrating SQL databases to Azure before the hands-on lab setup guide

## Requirements

- Microsoft Azure subscription must be pay-as-you-go or MSDN.
  - Trial subscriptions will _not_ work.

> **Important**: You must have sufficient rights within your Azure AD tenant to create an Azure Active Directory application and service principal and assign roles on your subscription to complete this hands-on lab.

## Before the hands-on lab

Duration: 15 minutes

In this exercise, you set up your environment for use in the rest of the hands-on lab. You should follow all steps provided _before_ attending the Hands-on lab.

> **Important**: Many Azure resources require globally unique names. Throughout these steps, the word "SUFFIX" appears as part of resource names. You should replace this with your Microsoft alias, initials, or other value to ensure uniquely named resources.

### Task 1: Create a resource group

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), select **Resource groups** from the Azure services list.

   ![Resource groups is highlighted in the Azure services list.](media/azure-services-resource-groups.png "Navigate to resource group")

2. On the Resource groups blade, select **+ Create**.

   ![Create is highlighted in the toolbar on Resource groups blade.](media/resource-groups-add.png "Create resource group")

3. On the Create a resource group **Basics** tab, enter the following:

   - **Subscription**: Select the subscription you are using for this hands-on lab.
   - **Resource group**: Enter `hands-on-lab-SUFFIX` as the name of the new resource group.
   - **Region**: Select the region you are using for this hands-on lab.

   ![The values specified above are entered into the Create a resource group Basics tab.](media/create-resource-group.png "Create resource group")

4. Select **Review + Create**.

5. On the **Review + create** tab, ensure the Validation passed message is displayed and then select **Create**.

### Task 2: Register the Microsoft DataMigration resource provider

In this task, you register the `Microsoft.DataMigration` resource provider with your Azure subscription. Registration of this resource provider is necessary to create an Azure Database Migration Service within your subscription.

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), from the **home page**, select **Subscriptions** from the Azure services list.

   ![Subscriptions is highlighted in the Azure services list.](media/azure-services-subscriptions.png "Azure services")

2. Select the subscription you are using for this hands-on lab from the list.

   ![The target subscription is highlighted in the subscriptions list.](media/azure-subscriptions.png "Subscriptions list")

3. On the Subscription blade, select **Resource providers** from the left-hand menu and then enter "migration" into the filter box.

   ![Resource providers is highlighted in the left-hand menu of the Subscription blade. On the Resource providers blade, migration is entered into the filter box.](media/azure-portal-subscriptions-resource-providers-register-microsoft-datamigration.png "Resource provider registration")

4. If the `Microsoft.DataMigration` provider's status is `NotRegistered`, select **Register** in the toolbar.

   ![The Register button is highlighted in the Resource Providers toolbar.](media/azure-subscriptions-resource-providers-toolbar.png "Resource providers toolbar")

5. It can take a couple of minutes for the registration to complete. Make sure you see the status set to **Registered** before moving on. You may need to select **Refresh** on the toolbar to see the updated status.

   ![Registered is highlighted next to the Microsoft.DataMigration resource provider.](media/resource-providers-datamigration-registered.png "Microsoft DataMigration Resource Provider")

### Task 3: Validate subscription compatibility with SQL MI

Before running the ARM template, it is beneficial to quickly verify that you can provision SQL Managed Instance in your subscription.

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), select **+Create a resource**.

   ![Create a resource from Azure Portal home page.](media/create-a-resource.png "Create a resource")

2. Enter **sql managed instance** into the Search the Marketplace box.
3. Then select **Azure SQL Managed Instance** from the results.

   ![+Create a resource is selected in the Azure navigation pane, and "sql managed instance" is entered into the Search the Marketplace box. Azure SQL Managed Instance is selected in the results.](media/create-resource-sql-mi.png "Create SQL Managed Instance")

4. Select **Create** on the Azure SQL Managed Instance blade.

   ![The Create button is highlighted on the Azure SQL Managed Instance blade.](media/sql-mi-create.png "Create Azure SQL Managed Instance")

5. On the SQL managed instance blade, look for a message stating that "Managed instance creation is not available for the chosen subscription type...", which will be displayed near the bottom of the SQL managed instance blade.

   ![A message is displayed stating that SQL MI creation not available in the selected subscription.](media/sql-mi-creation-not-available.png "SQL MI creation not available")

   > **Note**: If you see the message stating that Managed Instance creation is not available for the chosen subscription type, follow the instructions for [obtaining a larger quota for SQL Managed Instance](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sql-database/sql-database-managed-instance-resource-limits#obtaining-a-larger-quota-for-sql-managed-instance) before proceeding with the following steps.

6. Be happy if you don't have any warnings! Just **cancel** the current operation by closing the blade.

   ![The closing button is located on top left below user name.](media/cancel-resource-sql-mi.png "Cancel SQL MI resource creation")

### Task 4: Run ARM template to provision lab resources

In this task, you run an Azure Resource Manager (ARM) template to create the resources required for this hands-on lab. The components are deployed inside a new virtual network (VNet) to facilitate communication between the VMs and SQL MI. The ARM template also adds inbound and outbound security rules to the network security groups associated with SQL MI and the VMs, including opening port 3389 to allow RDP connections to the JumpBox. In addition to creating resources, the ARM template also executes PowerShell scripts on each of the VMs to install software and configure the servers. The resources created by the ARM template include:

- A virtual network with three subnets, ManagedInstance, Management, and a Gateway subnet.
- A virtual network gateway associated with the Gateway subnet.
- A route table.
- Azure SQL Managed Instance (SQL MI), added to the ManagedInstance subnet.
- A JumpBox with Visual Studio 2019 Community Edition and SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS installed, added to the Management subnet).
- A SQL Server 2008 R2 VM with the Data Migration Assistant (DMA) installed, added to the Management subnet.
- Azure Database Migration Service (DMS).
- Azure App Service Plan and App Service (Web App).
- Azure Blob Storage account.

> **Note**: You can review the steps to manually provision and configure the lab resources in the [Manual resource setup guide](./Manual-resource-setup.md).

You are now ready to begin the ARM template deployment.

1. To open a custom deployment screen in the Azure portal, use Azure search bar and type **deploy**:
2. Select the **Deploy a custom template** service in search results.

   ![Deploy a custom template by using search bar.](media/deploy-custom-template.png "Deploy custom template")

   > **Note**: Running the ARM template occasionally results in a `ResourceDeploymentFailure` error, with a code of `VnetSubnetConflictedWithIntendedPolicy`. This error is not caused by an issue with the ARM template and appears to be the result of backend resource deployment issues in Azure. At this time, the workaround is first to try the deployment in a different region. If that does not work, try going through the [Manual resource setup guide](./Manual-resource-setup.md) to create the SQL MI database.

3. On the custom deployment screen, select the **Build your own template in the editor** button.

   ![Locate and select the Build your own template in the editor button.](media/build-template-button.png "Build template button")

4. Use the **Load file** button or paste the contents of the file **Hands-on lab/lab-files/ARM-template/azure-deploy.json** from the repository.

5. Select the **Save** button to validate the template.

   ![Load file or paste content from lab file azure-deploy.json from ARM-template folder .](media/load-template-file.png "Load template file")

6. On the next custom deployment, check that **19 resources** are about to be created.

7. Only fill **two settings** into the deployment form, and **leave others as default**:

   - **Resource group**: Select the hands-on-lab-SUFFIX resource group from the dropdown list.
   - **Managed Instance Name**: Provide a globally unique value, such as **sqlmi-SUFFIX**.

8. Then select **Review + create** to review the custom deployment.

   ![The Custom deployment blade is displayed, and the information above is entered on the Custom deployment blade.](media/azure-custom-deployment.png "Custom deployment blade")

9. Wait for the **Review + create** blade to refresh, and ensure the _Validation passed_ message is displayed. Finally, select **Create** to begin the custom deployment.

   ![On the Review + create blade for the custom deployment, the Validation passed message is highlighted, and the Create button is highlighted.](media/azure-custom-deployment-review-create.png "Review + create custom deployment")

   > **Note**: The deployment of the custom ARM template can take over 4 hours due to the inclusion of SQL MI. However, the deployment of most of the resources completes within a few minutes. The JumpBox and SQL Server 2008 R2 VMs should finish in about 15 minutes.

10. You can monitor the deployment's progress any time by navigating to the **hands-on-lab-SUFFIX** resource group in the Azure portal and then selecting **Deployments** from the left-hand menu. The deployment is named **Microsoft.Template-xxxxxxx**. Select that to view the progress of each item in the template.

   ![The Deployments menu item is selected in the left-hand menu of the hands-on-lab-SUFFIX resource group and the Microsoft.Template deployment is highlighted.](media/resource-group-deployments.png "Resource group deployments")

> Check back in a few hours to monitor the progress of your SQL MI provisioning. If the provisioning goes on for longer than 7 hours, you may need to issue a support ticket in the Azure portal to request the provisioning process be unblocked by Microsoft support.

### Task 5: Install SSMS on the Jump Box

In this Task, you will install SQL Server Management Studio on the JumpBox. You will utilize this tool to manage the SQL Server 2008 R2 instance and eventually the SQL MI instance.

1. On your JumpBox VM blade, select **Connect** and **RDP** from the top menu.

   ![The JumpBox VM blade is displayed, with the Connect and RDP button highlighted in the top menu.](./media/connect-vm-rdp.png "Connect to JumpBox VM")

2. On the Connect with RDP blade, select **Download RDP File**, then open the downloaded RDP file.

   ![The Connect with RDP blade is displayed, and the Download RDP File button is highlighted.](./media/connect-to-virtual-machine-with-rdp.png "Connect with RDP")

   - **Username**: `sqlmiuser`
   - **Password**: Use the JumpBox secure password (`Password.1234567890`)

   ![The credentials specified above are entered into the Enter your credentials dialog.](media/rdc-credentials.png "Enter your credentials")

5. Select **Yes** to connect if you are prompted that the identity of the remote computer cannot be verified.

   ![In the Remote Desktop Connection dialog box, a warning states the identity of the remote computer cannot be verified, and asks if you want to continue anyway. At the bottom, the Yes button is circled.](./media/remote-desktop-connection-identity-verification-jumpbox.png "Remote Desktop Connection dialog")

6. Open a web browser on your JumpBox, navigate to <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/ssms/download-sql-server-management-studio-ssms> and then select the **Download SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS).x** link to download the latest version of SSMS.

   ![The Download SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) link is highlighted on the page specified above.](media/download-ssms.png "Download SSMS")

   > **Note**: Versions change frequently, so if the version number you see does not match the screenshot, download and install the most recent version.

   > **Note**: Internet Explorer ESC was disabled in the Custom Script Execution to allow you to download the SSMS executable. If it was not, the CSE may have failed, so please refer to Task 10 of the [Manual setup document.](Manual-resource-setup.md)

7. Run the downloaded installer.

8. On the Welcome screen, select **Install** to begin the installation.

    ![The Install button is highlighted on the SSMS installation welcome screen.](media/ssms-install.png "Install SSMS")

9. Select **Close** when the installation completes.

    ![The Close button is highlighted on the SSMS Setup Completed dialog.](media/ssms-install-close.png "Setup completed")

### Task 6: Install DMA on the SQL Server 2008 VM

1. As you did for the JumpBox, navigate to the SqlServer2008 VM blade in the Azure portal, select **Overview** from the left-hand menu, and then select **Connect** and **RDP** on the top menu.

   ![The SqlServer2008 VM blade is displayed, with the Connect button highlighted in the top menu.](./media/connect-vm-rdp.png "Connect to SqlServer2008 VM")

2. On the Connect with RDP blade, select **Download RDP File**, then open the downloaded RDP file.

3. Select **Connect** on the Remote Desktop Connection dialog.

   ![In the Remote Desktop Connection Dialog Box, the Connect button is highlighted.](./media/remote-desktop-connection-sql-2008.png "Remote Desktop Connection dialog")

4. Enter the following credentials when prompted, and then select **OK**:

   - **Username**: `sqlmiuser`
   - **Password**: Use the SqlServer2008 VM secure password (`Password.1234567890`)

   ![The credentials specified above are entered into the Enter your credentials dialog.](media/rdc-credentials-sql-2008.png "Enter your credentials")

5. Select **Yes** to connect, if prompted the identity of the remote computer cannot be verified.

   ![In the Remote Desktop Connection dialog box, a warning states the identity of the remote computer cannot be verified, and asks if you want to continue anyway. At the bottom, the Yes button is circled.](./media/remote-desktop-connection-identity-verification-sqlserver2008.png "Remote Desktop Connection dialog")

6. Close the Server Manager, as you will proceed to install the Microsoft Data Migration Assistant v5.x.

7. As **Microsoft Data Migration Assistant** requires .NET Framework 4.8 to operate, install it from the [Microsoft Site](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2088631) by pasting `https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2088631` into an Internet Explorer address bar.

8. **Download** and **Run** the installation package to proceed with new .NET Framework 4.8 setup.

9. Scroll down terms, **Accept** the license terms, and select **Install**.

    ![Read and agree framework .Net 4.8 license terms to proceed with installation.](media/agree-framework-4-8-terms.png "Agree framework .Net 4.8 license terms")

10. After framework setup, **restarting** the VM is required. Select **Restart now** when prompted, and wait a moment before connecting back to your VM. Generally, restarting takes less than two minutes.

    ![Restarting VM is required after .Net 4.8 setup is complete.](media/restart-after-framework-4-8-setup.png "Restart after framework .Net 4.8 setup")

11. Install **Microsoft Data Migration Assistant** on your SqlSever2008 VM by accessing the [download page](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=53595) with Internet Explorer.

12. Select **Download** to get the installation files.

    ![Copy the URL into Internet explorer then download installation file.](media/download-migration-assistant.png "Download Migration Assistant")

13. Complete the download. Execute the downloaded file on the SQL Server 2008 R2 VM.

    ![Proceed with complete installation when prompted.](media/proceed-complete-installation.png "Proceed complete installation")

14. As with the previous installation, start by selecting **Next**. Scroll down the license terms, **Accept** them, and select the **Install** button.

> **Important**
>
> Also, verify the `WideWorldImporters` database is up. The configuration script used by the ARM template may have failed during the VM setup. In this case, follow the steps under Task 12 of the [Manual-resource-setup guide](./Manual-resource-setup.md) to **manually restore and configure the database**.

You should follow all steps provided *before* performing the Hands-on lab.
